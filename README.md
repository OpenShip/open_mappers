Shipping carriers API integrations Library

- Integrate multiple carriers: DHL, FedEx and more with ease
- Use an intuitive, unified API across multiple carriers
- Move fast by just reading the carrier API documentation
- Use your developer credentials with negotiated rates
- Tested

purplship prevents you from reinventing the wheel and is easy to use:

```shell
>>> from purplship.mappers.dhl import  DHLClient, DHLProxy
>>> from purplship.domain.entities import Tracking
>>> client = DHLClient(
    "https://xmlpi-ea.dhl.com/XMLShippingServlet",
    "YOUR_DHL_SITE_ID",
    "YOUR_DHL_SITE_PASSWORD",
    "YOUR_DHL_ACCOUNT_NUMBER",
    "CARRIER_NAME"
  )
>>> proxy = DHLProxy(client)
>>> payload = Tracking.create(tracking_numbers=["8346088391"])
>>> tracking_req_xml_obj = proxy.mapper.create_tracking_request(payload)
>>> response = proxy.get_trackings(tracking_req_xml_obj)
>>> trackings = proxy.mapper.parse_tracking_response(response)
```
